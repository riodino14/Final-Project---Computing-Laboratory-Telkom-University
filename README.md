# üîç Final Project - SGA Data Science and Machine Learning Computing Laboratory, Telkom University üîç

I'm excited to announce the completion of my final project for the SGA Data Science and Machine Learning Computing Laboratory at Telkom University! The project involved creating an AI-powered chatbot using VertexAI, with the user interface built in Streamlit.

The chatbot was developed around the topic of Kabinet Baskara HIMA IF Universitas Telkom 2024, an organization within Telkom University that focuses on student engagement in Informatics based on the principles of Tridharma Perguruan Tinggi and Pancasila.

Key features of the chatbot include:

Detailed information about the organizational structure of Kabinet Baskara, including key figures such as Ketua Himpunan (Chair), Wakil Ketua (Vice-Chair), and department heads.
Quick and precise responses regarding the organization's programs, vision and mission, and departmental roles.
Interactive user interface using Streamlit for a seamless experience.
Through this project, I have deepened my understanding of data science, machine learning, and the application of conversational AI in a real-world setting.

Key skills applied:

VertexAI for building the conversational AI system.
Streamlit for developing an engaging user interface.
Python for backend integration and project deployment.
This project was an exciting opportunity to bring together advanced AI techniques and real-world organizational needs, and I look forward to applying these skills in future endeavors!
